Hi Team,

I got the Webpage Routing going.

Under the src/components folder:

New components added that made the Routing easier to understand.

Image folder is also added for easier accesss.

We have about 3 pages: Home, Visualizer and Algo Information.

I made a dummy for the Algo Information for Curtiss.

Problems: I've been trying to figure out how I can get the webpage size to adjust.

If you click on Visualizer link, the webpage is much bigger, but it isn't scrolling. 

I haven't figured it out. 


That is all for now.
