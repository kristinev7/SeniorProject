Hi Team,

I got the Webpage Routing going.

Under the src/components folder:

New components added that made the Routing easier to understand.

Image folder is also added for easier accesss.

We have about 3 pages: Home, Visualizer and Algo Information.

I made a dummy for the Algo Information for Curtiss.

Problems: I've been trying to figure out how I can get the webpage size to adjust.

If you click on Visualizer link, the webpage is much bigger, but it isn't scrolling. 

I haven't figured it out. 


That is all for now. Thank you.

Also some Git commands Information

git clone: grabbing all the files

git pull: merges changes/updates to my branch

git status

git checkout -b testbranch: creating a new branch and go to that branch

gitk: shows the gui

git add [folder/*]: * means all the files inside the folder

git add: to add these files to commit

git checkout: command to change branches/tags/commits

git checkout main: switches to main branch

MAKING A NEW REPO

git init inside the new folder where work will be done

git status

git add [folder]

git commit

git remote add origin [git url]

git push origin master
